# Nigeria-Food-Price-Tracker-Across-Geopolitical-Zones
A Data analytics project that explores food commodity prices and purchase volumes across major Nigerian markets (Abia , Oyo, Kano, FCT, and Lagos). The project answers key business questions including - Price difference across commodities, Most purchased food items, Seasonal buying trends, Regional demand patterns etc.

## The Goal
Turn raw, messy market data into clear, decision-ready insights using structued cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Data Observation
Before performing any cleaning or transformation, the following were observed;

~ Incomplete months for 2025 (missing May, June, and July; irregular timeline)
~ Complete monthly records for 2022–2024 (January–December)
~ Mixed and inconsistent spellings
~ Duplicate values
~ Case inconsistencies (sentence/uppercase variations)
~ General formatting inconsistencies across columns

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following data cleaning process were done;
~ Corrected misspellings
~ Removed duplicates
~ Standardized text cases and formats
~ Handled missing and inconsistent date entries
~ Created helper columns for: Year, Month,
~ Date structure
~ States
~ Political zones (for broader regional analysis)

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning & validation
SQL – Additional querying and detailed review
Power Query (Power BI) – Data transformation
Power BI – Visualization & dashboard creation

## Business Questions Explored
Analysis was guided by real buyer/wholesaler thinking rather than random metrics:
~ What market makes the most sales?
~ What market offers the lowest unit price?
~ What commodity is the most bought?
~ What commodity is the most sought after?
~ What state has the highest overall commodity purchase?
~ Across the timeline, what year recorded the highest bulk sales volume?
~ What time of the year are prices cheaper in volume?

## Output
An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to present:
~ Market performance comparison
~ Price trends
~ Commodity demand patterns
~ State-level purchase distribution
~ Yearly and seasonal volume analysis
The dashboard was designed to be simple and understandable for both technical and non-technical users.

## Result
The final output transforms raw food price data into actionable insights that can help:
~ Wholesalers choose better markets
~ Buyers identify cheaper periods
~ Track demand trends
~ Support data-driven pricing decisions
